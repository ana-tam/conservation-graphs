# The Datasets

This directory contains the cleaned versions of public datasets used for this research.  A link to the original source is included.  However, there may be differences between the latest source versions at these links and that used in this study (i.e. more recent versions, or they have not been prepared to work in this pipeline).  All scripts found in the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 folders were written to work with these prepared datasets.
