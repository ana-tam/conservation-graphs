// Theta = (the count of nodes with degree less than or equal to 1) / [divided by] (the total node count)

The numerator for the theta ratio, ùõ≥, as presented by Kaiser (2008) can be calculated using Cypher and the APOC library with the following query:
//Gives a count of leaf and isolated nodes
MATCH (a)
Where apoc.node.degree(a) <=1
Return Count(a)
