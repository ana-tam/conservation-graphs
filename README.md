# Conservation Graphs

This is the companion repository for the PhD thesis *Applying Graph Theory to Conservation Documentation* by Ana Tam (202X, University of the Arts London). 
Scripts are written in Python for data wrangling and Cypher for Neo4j graph database modelling and analysis.

## Structure of the Repository

The contents of this repository mirror the structure of the thesis:

directory | content
--- | ---
Datasets | The final prepared versions of the datasets used to create the graph models.
Data Preparation | The scripts to pre-process and wrangle the datasets (including NLP, html scraping, and API requests).
Phase 1 | Initial build (ETL) scripts, validation queries (Cypher), and graph algorithm scripts
Phase 2 | Graph theoretic investigations of existing cultural heritage knowledge graphs
Phase 3 | Revised build (ETL) scripts, graph algorithms scripts, and validation queries (Cypher) and SHACL
Misc | Script snippets or derivations of those used in the main research that may be of interest to the community.
